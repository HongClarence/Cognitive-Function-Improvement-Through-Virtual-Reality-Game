# Objectives
The main objective of the project is to design and develop ‘Brainworks’, a prototype
Virtual Reality game, that is able to effectively train an individual’s cognitive function, targetted mostly at elderlies.

Presently, there are countless amount of cognitive training games available on the
market. However, in terms of Virtual Reality cognitive training games, there are little
to none currently.

The goal of the game is to be one of the pioneers in the Virtual Reality cognitive training
field, while differentiating the game from usual non-Virtual Reality games by taking
advantage of the interactivity provided by Virtual Reality, potentially increasing the
effectiveness of the cognitive training.

# Minigames
There are a total of 4 minigames, separated into 2 categories with 2 minigames each. 
The minigames are made such that it is simple yet engaging, allowing the player to easily learn and pick up the minigame.
The actions required in the minigame are associated with daily activities.

# Game Modes
## Free Play Mode
Free Play Mode is the default game mode. When the player launches the game, they
will be loaded into Free Play Mode. The aim of Free Play Mode is to allow the players
to take their time and practice the different minigames. Since there is not time limit,
players will not be pressured and can leisurely train their cognitive function. Free Play
Mode also allow the players to push their limits, trying to achieve the highest difficulty
per minigame.
## Tutorial Mode
Tutorial Mode can be loaded from the menu panel under ‘Tutorial’. The aim of Tutorial
Mode is to allow the player to learn the minigames by providing them with step-bystep instructions. Tutorial Mode will include the instructions of each step that the player
is required to do, as well as providing them with floating arrows pointing at what they
need to interact with. For the Fruit and Word Game, the answers are given on a panel
to allow the players to familiarize with the minigame. Similar to Free Play Mode, there
is no time limit as well and the player can try the tutorial as long as they like.
## Challenge Mode
Challenge Mode can be loaded from the menu panel under ‘Challenge. The aim of
Challenge Mode is to allow the player to train their cognitive function by requiring them
to get as many correct answers as possible given a time limit of 1 minute. Challenge
Mode promotes friendly competition to motivate players to push their own limits and

achieve higher scores. At the end of Challenge Mode, a summary panel will be shown,
displaying the player’s current score, high score and the minigame’s leaderboard.

# Future Works
There is much more room for enhancements that would improve the effectiveness of
the game on cognitive function.

## More Minigames
At the moment, the game only consists of a total of 4 minigames in 2 categories as a
prototype. More categories of games can be implemented such as, ‘Reasoning’ and
‘Attention’. This will provide a more holistic cognitive training for the player.

## Graphical Improvements
Currently, the game uses royalty free assets found online. The graphics of such free
assets are usually simple and not as realistic. With an budget or time, more realistic
assets could be bought or designed. This will improve the player experience and
provide a more immersive experience. Better graphical hardware could help with the
immersion as well as by increasing the quality of the graphics and the frames per
second.

## Artificial Intelligence
An artificial intelligence (AI) can be added where the players’ scores and progression
are processed, and then generate a personal curated training program. The AI can
help find the weaknesses and strengths of the players’ cognitive function and
recommend different minigames with adjusted difficulty to help increase the
effectiveness of the cognitive training.
