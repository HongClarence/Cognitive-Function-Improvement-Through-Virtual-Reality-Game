# Objectives
The main objective of the project is to design and develop ‘Brainworks’, a prototype
Virtual Reality game, that is able to effectively train an individual’s cognitive function.

Presently, there are countless amount of cognitive training games available on the
market. However, in terms of Virtual Reality cognitive training games, there are little
to none currently.

The goal of the game is to be one of the pioneers in the Virtual Reality cognitive training
field, while differentiating the game from usual non-Virtual Reality games by taking
advantage of the interactivity provided by Virtual Reality, potentially increasing the
effectiveness of the cognitive training.
